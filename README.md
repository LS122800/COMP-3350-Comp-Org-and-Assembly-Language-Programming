# 4 coding projects done for the Auburn University Fall 2021 COMP-3350 Section 001

Project 1: Create a program that will read a value from an array, add another value to this, and save the sum of those two values into a specific register

Project 2: Create a program that will read a value from an array, and then place this value in another array with the location shifted by a certain amount. 
The array may be of any length from 2 to 100. Your program must be flexible enough to produce the correct solution regardless of the array size.
