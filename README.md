Project 1: Create a program that will read a value from an array, add another value to this, and save the sum of those two values into a specific register
Grade: 100/100

Project 2: Create a program that will read a value from an array, and then place this value in another array with the location shifted by a certain amount. 
The array may be of any length from 2 to 100. Your program must be flexible enough to produce the correct solution regardless of the array size. 
Grade: 100/100

Project 3: Create a program that will determine if two strings are anagrams. If the two strings are anagrams, then EAX will have the value 1 after the code has been completed.
If they are not anagrams, then EAX will have the value 0. All "high-level" directives are not allowed on this homework. (e.g. IF, ENDIF, REPEAT, etc)

Project 4: Create a procedure that will take plaintext and an encryption key, use the Vigenère cipher, and encrypt the plaintext. 
The second objective is to create a procedure that will take cypher-text, an encryption key, use the Vigenère cipher, and decrypt the cypher-text
Assume that all characters will be uppercase letters, no spaces, symbols, etc. All "high-level" directives are not allowed on this homework. (e.g. IF, ENDIF, REPEAT, etc)
